    <div>Project files for ffDiaporama are XML files with .ffd extension.</div>
    <ul>
        <li>This XML file does not contain copies of the multimedia elements (image, video, music) which are included in the project but only links to these files.</li>
        <li>The links are relative to the location of the .ffd file. This ensures that if the directory containing the project file (.ffd ) also contains the multimedia elements (directly or in subdirectories), it is possible to move and/or to rename the directory.</li>
        <li>Another advantage is that a project created under Linux can be opened under Windows and conversely.</li>
    </ul>
