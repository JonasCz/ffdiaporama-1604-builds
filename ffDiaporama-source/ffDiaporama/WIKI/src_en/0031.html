    <div>A digital video consists of a computer file called the <a href="0038.html">container</a></div>
    <div>In this file we find:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>One or more video tracks. Each track is built using a <a href="0036.html">Video Codec</a></li>
        <li>One or more audio tracks. Each track is built using an <a href="0037.html">Audio Codec</a></li>
        <li>Possibly, one or more subtitles. Each subtitle is built in a subtitle format.</li>
        <li>Possibly, a definition of tags and chapters.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Limitations :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>ffDiaporama does not manage subtitles.</li>
        <li>ffDiaporama generates files that include a single video track and a single audio track.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Unlike music files, which are widely portable from one device to another, videos require a certain amount of juggling between various formats to adapt to the equipment used to play them.</div>
    <div>A video rendered for a "Home Cinema" device can occupy several Gb and will be unreadable on a smartphone.</div>
    <div>The same video rendered for a smartphone will require only one Mb, and can be played on a "Home Cinema" device but it will look ugly.</div>
    <div>That is why we recommend that you preserve your original project files as far as possible, and create from them videos suitable for the devices you wish to use for playback.</div>
    <br>
    <div>To simplify settings for the rendering operation, ffDiaporama contains predefined settings for the following devices:</div>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="0032.html">Smartphones</a> and <a href="0033.html">portable devices</a>, and small video-playing devices in general</li>
        <li><a href="0034.html">Multimedia systems</a> for domestic use ("Home Cinema" devices)</li>
        <li><a href="0035.html">Display on the Web</a> (blogs, picture-sharing and social networking sites)</li>
    </ul>
    <div>It is also possible for you to define all parameters directly by using the advanced option.</div>
