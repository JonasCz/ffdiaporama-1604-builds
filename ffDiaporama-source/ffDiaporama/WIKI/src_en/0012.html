        Predefined title slide are complete slides including formatting and animations.
        <br>The main interest of these slides is to standardize the slides within a project or across projects.
        <br>
        <br>ffDiaporama included many Predefined title slides, but you can also define your own Predefined title slides.
        <br>To do this, create a standard slide using the <a href="0119.html">Slide properties dialog box</a> and save your slide as a model using:
        <ul><li><img src="img/db_menu_big.png"> Save as model function.</li></ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Remarks:</h4>
    <div><ul>
        <li>Predefined title slides are defined according to the following three categories:
            <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td nowrap valign="top"><img src="img/object_text.png">Project title</td>
                    <td>This type of slide is usually used early in the project as the opening credits.
                        <br>The texts variables that are used by the models of this slide type are based only on project information. For more information on project information, see: <a href="0108.html">Project properties dialog</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td nowrap valign="top"><img src="img/Chapter_big.png">Chapter title</td>
                    <td>This type of slide is usually used several times in the project to mark the beginning of the chapter.
                        <br>The texts variables that are used by the models of this slide type are based on project information and on chapter information.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td nowrap valign="top"><img src="img/medal.png">Credit title</td>
                    <td>This type of slide is usually used at the end of the project as the end credits.
                        <br>The texts variables that are used by the models of this slide type are generally computed.  For more information on texts variables, see: <a href="0013.html">Dynamic variables</a></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody></table>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
        </li>
        <li>Within each category, the predefined title slides are classified into the following types:
            <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td nowrap valign="top">Statics models</td>
                    <td>This type lists statics models ie without animations.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td nowrap valign="top">Animated models</td>
                    <td>This type lists animated models ie with several shots.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td nowrap valign="top">Custom models</td>
                    <td>This type lists the templates that you saved with the <b><i>Save as model</i></b> function of the <a href="0119.html">Slide properties</a> dialog box.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody></table>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
        </li>
        <li><div>The resources used by the models you create are not moved. So, if you include a photo in a model, the model will only be valid until the picture will not move. This is why it is recommended, to think resources included before creating a new model.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div></li>
        <li>It will always be possible to create slides from a model using the <a href="0103.html">Add or modify a predefined title slide dialog box</a> then convert it to a standard slide using this function: <ul><li><img src="img/transparent.png"> Convert to standard slide</li></ul></li>
    </ul></div>
