    <div>Blocks have a visible/invisible property. In the following example, the one image is inserted 3 times (in 3 different blocks) into the same slide.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>The first block consists of the whole image filling the whole screen</li>
      <li>The second block consists of the image re-framed on the statue and positioned in an ellipse at the right of the screen</li>
      <li>The third block consists of the image re-framed on the pedestrians and also positioned in an ellipse at the right of the screen</li>
    </ul>
    <div><img src="wiki_img/Animation_3.png"></div>
    <div>The statue and the pedestrians have their visibility property set to invisible on the 1st shot.</div>
    <div>Then the statue becomes visible on the 2nd shot.</div>
    <div>Finally, the statue once more becomes invisible on the 3rd shot and the pedestrians become visible.</div>
    <br>
    <h4>Result:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>For 2 seconds, the 1st shot is shown and we see only the whole image which occupies all the screen</li>
      <li>Over the next 2 seconds, the statue appears</li>
      <li>Over a further 2 seconds, the statue is replaced by the pedestrians</li>
    </ul>
    <div>This example is really very simple, because it is also possible to animate the appearance and the disappearance of blocks.</div>
    <div>Indeed, as shown previously, animations are generated by the transformation of the arrangement from one shot to another.</div>
    <div>So, if on the 1st shot, the statue occupied the left lower quarter of the screen rather than the same position as on the 2nd shot, then instead of simply appearing for 2 seconds on the 2nd shot, it would appear by growing out of the left lower quarter of the screen.</div>
    <br>
    <h4>Using videos:</h4>
    <div>You should note that videos are paused when they are invisible.</div>
    <div>Therefore a video can be displayed for several seconds in the 1st shot, then be made invisible and thus paused in a 2nd shot, then be visible in a 3rd shot and resume playing, from where it stopped at the end of the 1st shot.</div>
