    <h2>Render the movie</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        Once you have selected the device or set the advanced parameters, one click on the OK button starts the process of rendering the video.
        <br>At any time during this process, one click on the &quot;Cancel&quot; button stops the process.
        <h4>Remarks:</h4>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <u>Rendering duration:</u><br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Depending on the device model or the advanced parameters which you selected, the generation can take quite a long time.
                <br>Generally, for a Full-HD 1080p video:
                <ul>
                    <li>On a PC with 4 fast cores (Core i7 for example) : The process will take approximately 2 minutes for each minute of video to be rendered</li>
                    <li>On a PC with 2 cores (Core 2 duo for example) : The process will take approximately 5 minutes for each minute of video to be rendered</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                This amounts to 2 to 5 hours for a one-hour video.
                <br>This duration will be much shorter for a video in VGA resolution. That is why we recommend you to carry out all tests and focusing trials at low resolution, and to render your videos in Full-HD only for the last step.
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <u>Variable bitrate:</u><br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                If variable bitrate is activated, the video compression bitrate could vary from -50% to +125%
                <ul>
                    <li>If the project contains mostly pictures, this option can significantly reduce the size of the video file (up to 80%)</li>
                    <li>By cons, if the project contains mostly videos this option will increase the size of the video file</li>
                </ul>
                By default, variable bitrate is activated when duration of videos are less than half of the total duration of the projet.
            </div>

    <h2>At the dialog bottom</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        The properties button allows you to open the <a href="0108.html">Project properties dialog</a>. It allows you to adjust the properties before generating the video.
        <br>Note: the project properties are saved into the video as TAG (METADATA) which are used by a lot of indexing programs or by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_center">Media Center Systems</a>.
